        "readMoreData": "As part of its commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility, IIT Hyderabad has established a Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAQMS) with the support of the Telangana State Pollution Control Board under the National Clean Air Programme.The CAQMS is now fully operational, providing near real-time data on air quality, displayed at the main gate in intervals of 15 minutes to 1 hour. The station measures key pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, O3, NH3, and CO, along with critical weather parameters such as wind direction, wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity.This advanced monitoring setup is managed by a third party responsible for the maintenance, calibration, and optimization of the analyzers, probes, and electronics to ensure precise data collection. The data generated is currently under observation, contributing to research, analysis, and informed decision-making to improve air quality on campus and beyond.This initiative aligns with IIT Hyderabad's broader sustainability goals, aiming to create a healthier, cleaner environment while fostering awareness about air quality and climate action. By leveraging state-of-the-art technology, the Institute continues to lead efforts in monitoring and mitigating environmental challenges."

        "description": "The campus promotes biodiversity through plantation drives, composting, and sustainable practices for a greener environment.",
        "readMoreHref": "/initiatives/local-biodiversity",
        "readMoreData": "IIT Hyderabad is dedicated to minimizing its environmental footprint and fostering biodiversity through impactful, community-driven initiatives. These efforts aim to create a greener, more sustainable campus while enhancing the local ecosystem.Since October 2020, monthly plantation drives have been conducted, bringing the campus community together to plant indigenous species across the campus. The first Saturday of every month is observed as Plantation Day, resulting in the successful planting of over 15,000 plants spanning more than 100 varieties of species. To ensure the health and growth of these plants, a drip irrigation system is being implemented.To reduce the use of harmful chemicals, IIT Hyderabad has established a vermicomposting facility that processes organic waste into nutrient-rich compost for campus greenery. Additionally, the campus has implemented a ban on single-use plastics, promoting eco-friendly alternatives and sustainable practices.These initiatives reflect IIT Hyderabad's commitment to preserving biodiversity, reducing environmental impact, and nurturing a culture of sustainability. Through these efforts, the Institute not only enriches the campus environment but also sets an example for sustainable living and responsible ecological stewardship."
