        "readMoreData":"IIT Hyderabad (IITH) has embraced the Miyawaki Method of plantation as part of its commitment to environmental sustainability and biodiversity. This innovative technique, developed by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, involves creating dense, native forests in a short period. At IITH, the Miyawaki plantations consist of a diverse mix of indigenous tree species planted closely together, mimicking the natural ecosystem. These mini-forests grow up to 10 times faster than conventional plantations and provide numerous ecological benefits, such as improved air quality, enhanced carbon sequestration, and a boost to local biodiversity.The Miyawaki Method aligns perfectly with IITH's status as a Net-Zero Carbon campus, contributing to its goal of reducing carbon emissions and enhancing greenery. These dense forests not only create a self-sustaining ecosystem but also serve as a living laboratory for students and researchers to study ecological restoration and sustainability practices. By integrating such pioneering environmental initiatives, IITH continues to inspire its community and demonstrate innovative approaches to combating climate change while preserving the planet's natural resources."

        "readMoreData":"IIT Hyderabad (IITH) employs advanced radiant cooling systems as part of its sustainable infrastructure, showcasing a commitment to energy efficiency and innovative climate control. Radiant cooling uses chilled water circulated through panels or pipes embedded in ceilings, floors, or walls, enabling heat to be absorbed directly from the surrounding environment. This method is significantly more energy-efficient than traditional air conditioning, as it eliminates the need for energy-intensive air circulation systems and reduces electricity consumption.The implementation of radiant cooling at IITH not only enhances thermal comfort for occupants but also aligns with the institute's Net-Zero Carbon goals by minimizing carbon emissions associated with cooling. This cutting-edge system exemplifies IITH's leadership in adopting green technologies, serving as both a model for sustainable campus design and a research opportunity for students and faculty. By integrating such innovative solutions, IITH demonstrates how modern engineering can harmonize with environmental responsibility."

The club focuses on helping these students prepare for scholarship exams like NMMS and conducts awareness sessions on topics such as cleanliness and health. Every Saturday, volunteers visit nearby government schools to mentor students, providing them with guidance and encouragement. Additionally, the club visits a local orphanage to spend time teaching, playing games like cricket and chess, and engaging with the children to bring joy and learning into their lives. The club operates entirely on a volunteer basis, allowing anyone free over the weekend to contribute meaningfully.One of Prayas's major achievements was organizing Prerna, its first large-scale program, where students and parents from nearby government schools were invited to the IIT Hyderabad campus. The event featured inspirational talks by esteemed guests, including IPS officers, IRS officers, and professors, many of whom were alumni of government schools. This connection inspired both the students and their parents by showing them what is possible through dedication and hard work. The event also included a campus tour, offering the students a glimpse of opportunities that higher education can provide. Started by a Ph.D. student, Prayas continues to carry forward her vision, striving to make a lasting impact on the lives of children through mentorship, education, and heartfelt support."
